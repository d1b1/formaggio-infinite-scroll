## The Infinity Cheese Board
### api.formagg.io + Infinity.js

This is a working example of the AirBnb Infinity.js library
for infinite scrolling. It uses the Formagg.io API for an
ever changing supply of cheese, and cheese makers. This example
was intended as an test to find way to use infinity.js in
a backbone.js app, still working.

Based upon the <http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-on.html> demo.
