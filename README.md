## The Infinity Cheese Board

### Api.Formagg.io + Infinity.js

This is a example of the [AirBnb Infinity.js](http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/) library
for infinite scrolling. It uses the Formagg.io API for an
ever changing supply of cheeses, and cheese makers. This example
was intended as an test bed to explore use infinity.js library in
a backbone.js app, still working on it...

Based upon the [AirBnb Infinity.js Demo](http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-on.html).

#### Formagg.io
