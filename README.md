### The Infinity Cheese Board
## api.formagg.io + Infinity.js

This is a working example of the AirBnb Infinity.js library
for infinite scrolling. It uses the Formagg.io API for an
ever changing supply of cheese, and cheese makers.

Based upon the <http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-on.html> demo.
